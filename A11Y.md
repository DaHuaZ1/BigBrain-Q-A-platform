# Accessibility Improvements (A11Y)

This project applies several standard accessibility principles discussed in lectures to ensure that the app is usable by a broader range of users, including those using assistive technologies.

## ðŸ§­ Semantic HTML and ARIA Roles
- **Semantic elements** such as `<button>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, and `<form>` are used across pages to help screen readers interpret content correctly.
- All icons used in buttons (e.g., `Play`, `Stop`, `View`) are wrapped in appropriate tooltips and use `<Tooltip>` components from MUI, providing descriptive `aria-label`s for screen reader users.

## ðŸ”¡ Input Labels and Descriptions
- All form elements, such as email, password, and captcha fields in `loginPage.jsx` and `registerPage.jsx`, have clear and visible labels.
- The `CanvasCaptcha` includes a text field label and generated CAPTCHA image, giving users both visual and textual input cues.

## â™¿ Keyboard Navigation
- All modals (`Modal`, `Dialog`) and buttons are navigable using the `Tab` key, as ensured by using native `<button>` elements or accessible MUI components.
- We avoid custom keyboard traps and ensure that modal dialogs can be closed using keyboard navigation (e.g., `Escape` key or tabbing to the close button).

## ðŸŽ¨ Color and Contrast
- Button text and backgrounds meet WCAG 2.1 contrast guidelines. For example, warning sections use readable combinations like `#fff8c5` on `#ad6800` text (e.g., in result explanation).

## ðŸ§ª Dynamic Updates with Announcements
- Game session updates, like result displays or session prompts, use Ant Design `message` or `SnackbarProvider` (from `notistack`) for time-sensitive alerts that are keyboard- and screen-reader friendly.

Weâ€™ve followed accessibility guidelines in structuring layouts, labeling controls, and designing navigation flow to enhance usability for all users.
