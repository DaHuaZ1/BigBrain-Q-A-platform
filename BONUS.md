# BONUS Features (Implemented by Yuxin)

## CAPTCHA on Login & Register
- When users register or log in, a visual CAPTCHA (e.g. "P5VZ") 
- The CAPTCHA includes distortion to make recognition harder for machines.
- Implemented on the frontend only
- Idea inspired by [Bilibili tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1T64y1f7kM), but all actual code was written from scratch.

## Snake Game While Waiting
- When players wait for the admin to start the game, they're shown a waiting screen.
- I added a simple Snake game ("Try Snake!") by using canvas to improve the waiting experience.
- The game logic references [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Je0B3nHhKmM) and was rewritten to fit the project requirements.
